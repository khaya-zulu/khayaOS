Hi, I’m Khaya👋 A full-stack web developer, Born in the month November, 2001 in Johannesburg on a rainy day (or at least that story was told to me).

**Fun fact:** My brother, born just a year after me, shares the same birthday as me.

At this time in my career, I work with a small team of engineers @snaplet. Trying to make it safe & easy for teams to work with production data, in local dev environments.

This is my personal website. Learn about my Travels (a short but sweet list 😂), concerts & taste in music or my uneducated pieces on software development, Africa and life.
