Motion is an animationed library powered by WAAPI. I was asked to be a co-author on this project by [Jude Hunter](https://github.com/judehunter?tab=repositories) (they [github](https://github.com/judehunter?tab=repositories) says enough ðŸ˜‚)

**Future**

We have plans to build a whole toolkit (Figma plugin, Browser dev tool). I guess finding time to get back into it again. I would like to export a gsap like api for vanilla html. Offer more than what WAPPI gives (i.e. springs).
