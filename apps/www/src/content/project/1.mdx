Astro, Typescript, Spotify API

**Description 📖**

Khaya, meaning “Home” in Zulu (which is why I kept the name KhayaOS). Is an astro plugin/template, built using their integrations API and WAAPI.

I’ve always been working on my personal website, but I’ve also always had the idea, to build something, that developers without time or even the skills (yet), could spin up for themselves

I previously used KeystoneJS, but switched to using Astro’s content collection builtin as an alternative to the headless CMS. Having to set up NodeJS, postgres for a python developer or first uni grad, was to much.

**Future work 🕥**

I’m excited for Astro Studio, hopefully being a solution for managing collections (my guess, could be wrong). I would also like to give Keystatic a go (specifically with the github mode).

This project basically started in 2019 (yearly design changes 😄), because I wanted something I could over-engineer. I’m keen on adding something like Pocketbase or Supabase to power an editor mode. Or a service like Upstash for storing “Spotify last played” or “View of notes”.
